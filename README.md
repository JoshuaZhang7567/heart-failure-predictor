Heart Failure Predictor

A small machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart failure using patient health data.
Built with Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

Dataset

The project uses the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle.
It contains patient information such as age, blood tests, and medical history, along with whether heart failure occurred.

How it Works

Loads and preprocesses the dataset (heart.csv)

Trains a neural network on patient features

Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on predicting heart failure

Usage

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/JoshuaZhang7567/heart-failure-predictor.git
cd heart-failure-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the script:

python heart.py
